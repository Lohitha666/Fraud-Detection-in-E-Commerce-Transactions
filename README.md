# 🚀 Fraud Detection in E-Commerce Transactions  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Fraud Detection in E-Commerce Transactions** system is a machine learning-based solution designed to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. By analyzing patterns and anomalies in transaction data, the model can detect suspicious activities and help reduce financial losses.  

## 🚀 Getting Started  
Follow the steps below to download, set up, and run the project on your local machine.  

# 1️⃣ Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.8+  
- pip (latest version)  
- Scikit-learn & TensorFlow for machine learning  
- Pandas & NumPy for data processing  
- Flask or FastAPI (optional for API deployment)  

# 2️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```sh  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git  
cd repo-name  
```

# 3️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```sh  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

# 4️⃣ Dataset Preparation  
The system requires a dataset containing transactional records with fraud labels. If using a custom dataset, store it in the `data/` directory.  
Example CSV format:  
```csv  
transaction_id,amount,category,location,timestamp,is_fraud  
12345,1000,"Electronics","New York",1622567890,1  
67890,50,"Clothing","Los Angeles",1622567990,0  
```

# 5️⃣ Train the Model  
To train the fraud detection model, run:  
```sh  
python train.py  
```
This will preprocess the data, train the model, and save it for later use.  

# 6️⃣ Run Fraud Detection  
To test the model on new transactions, run:  
```sh  
python predict.py --input test_data.csv  
```
The system will classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.  

# 7️⃣ Deploy as an API (Optional)  
To serve the model using Flask/FastAPI, run:  
```sh  
python app.py  
```
Then open your browser and go to:  
[http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict?transaction=your_data](http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict?transaction=your_data)  

# 🎯 Features
